						You Know Your Native VS Non-Native Plants? QUIZ | TreePeople</a>
					<br /><small>Here in Southern California, the work that TreePeople
						does - especially in the surrounding mountains and wildland areas -
						involves restoring the land to a state in which native plant species
						can thrive and help the land. In fact, our native plants that have
						evolved with our ecosystems are more fire resilient and have better
						chances of surviving wildfires (see example here). This means we
						spend a lot of time removing non-native, invasive species from our
						planting sites.</small>

						landscape and install a cistern to fight drought and adapt to our
						new climate reality. Cisterns and rain barrels are both rain tanks
						used to store captured rainwater. Smaller tanks (rain barrels)
						typically store around 55 gallons of water. Larger tanks (cisterns)
						store 200 gallons or more. They can be both above or under ground.
						The average home cistern stores 800 - 1500 gallons.</small>

							<br /><small>LA is rich in natural beauty. But along the way,
								we&#039;ve over-paved this paradise. Many LA neighborhoods are
								almost completely covered in asphalt and concrete and sorely
								lacking trees and nature.  On hot days, scorching surfaces bake
								in the heat, endangering people’s health. Our streams and rivers
								are paved over, so that when it rains, water can&#039;t soak
								into the ground where it could add to our aquifers. Instead, it
								runs off into our ocean, sweeping trash and pollution onto our
								beaches.</small>

							<br /><small>USTED puede marcar la diferencia hoy mismo uniéndose
								a nuestro equipo de voluntarios. Tenemos una visión de un Los
								Ángeles más verde, pero, para alcanzarla, dependemos de la ayuda
								de voluntarios como usted para transformar nuestra región en un
								ecosistema urbano saludable, una comunidad a la vez. El ser
								voluntario con nosotros es divertido y gratificador. Además es
								distinto a las experiencias típicas como voluntario porque
								nosotros lo habilitamos a USTED con el apoyo, la capacitación y
								las herramientas que necesita para ser promotor del
								cambio.</small>

								22 beneficios principales de los árboles | TreePeople</a>
							<br /><small>Aquí tiene las mejores 22 razones para plantar y
								cuidar árboles o defender la importancia de los árboles Los
								árboles combaten el cambio climático El exceso de dióxido de
								carbono (CO2) causado por muchos factores se está acumulando en
								nuestra atmósfera y está contribuyendo al cambio climático. Los
								árboles absorben el CO2, removiendo y almacenando el carbono al
								tiempo que liberan oxígeno al aire. En un año, un acre de
								árboles adultos absorbe la cantidad producida cuando usted
								conduce su automóvil 26 mil millas.  </small>

							<br /><small>La región de Los Ángeles podrá estar cubierta con
								pavimento, pero la buena nueva es que sus habitantes han estado
								plantando y cuidando sus árboles como nunca antes. Ahora, con
								una sequía de magnitud histórica, debemos asegurarnos de que
								estos árboles sobrevivan. TreePeople posee herramientas y
								recursos para que usted no solo aumente nuestra cobertura de
								árboles con las especies apropiadas, sino también ayude a
								conservar agua y asegurarse de que, cuando llueva en LA, el agua
								tenga la oportunidad de absorberse en el suelo y reabastecer
								nuestros acuíferos.</small>

							<br /><small>Los Ángeles cuenta con una gran cantidad de belleza
								natural, pero, con el paso de los años, hemos pavimentado
								demasiadas zonas de este paraíso. Muchos vecindarios de Los
								Ángeles están casi completamente cubiertos con asfalto y
								concreto y carecen de árboles y naturaleza. En los días
								calurosos, las superficies calientes se cocinan al sol, haciendo
								un peligro para la salud de la gente . Hemos pavimentado
								nuestros arroyos y ríos y, por eso, cuando llueve, la tierra no
								puede absorber el agua, donde podría agregarse a nuestros
								acuíferos.</small>
