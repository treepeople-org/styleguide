        <h1 class="p-name">Trees are the largest living things on Earth. </h1>
        <p class="standfirst">Next to a giant sequoia tree, a human being looks very small.</p>
        <p class="p-summary lede">Even the dinosaurs that once liven on our planet could hide in its shadows! Trees can be very old, too. Some species can live for hundreds or even thousands of years. Only a few humans lives to be a hundred years old, but for most trees, a hundred years is just the beginning of their life.</p>

          <p>Trees show the incredible power of nature. Trees are huge plants that grow from tiny seeds. In places with a temperate climate their branches grow leaves and flowers every spring. Later in the year, some trees bear fruit and then lose their leaves before winter arrives. The whole cycle is repeated the next year. Eventually, like all living things, the old tree will die, but a new one will grow in its place.</p>
          <p>In many places in the world, trees have been as sacred. They are revered for their magical powers, and some believe that they are the homes of spririts or ghosts. One of the many examples of the presence of trees in art and culture are Mexican “trees of life,” which are clay sculptures representing a tree whose branches are filled with symbols, objects and images. Despite their bright colors, they often depict a serious message. They sometimes feature scenes from the Bible or images of life and death, mixed together.</p>
          <p>Trees also have great practical importance, because they are the source of wood, which is a valuable and beautiful material. Wood is used to make everyday objects, works of art, andd all kinds of buildings. It is also used to make paper for books, like this one. </p>
